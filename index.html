<h1 style="font-family:Luminari; font-size:50px; color:#63b010;">Shrek the Ogre</h1>
<p style="font-family:Papyrus; color:#f0efe6; margin:10px 40px;">Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre named Shrek whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsqpVl0TVek&ab_channel=KhoiTran">fairy tale characters</a>. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad. Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret.<br>
Years later, Shrek has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvSGGd3ewFI&ab_channel=Movieclips">rescued Princess Fiona</a>, got married, and now is time to meet the parents. Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey set off to Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's mother and father. But not everyone is happy. Shrek and King Harold find it hard to get along, and there's tension in the marriage. It's not just the family who are unhappy. Prince Charming returns from a failed attempt at rescuing Fiona, and works alongside his mother, the Fairy Godmother, to try and find a way to get Shrek away from Fiona.<br>
When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7NcgNF-xFw&ab_channel=ShaunO%27Hagan">King Harold suddenly croaks</a>, Shrek learns he will have to rule the land of Far, Far Away, unless he can find a suitable heir to the throne. The most-promising candidate is Princess Fiona's cousin Artie, a teenage slacker in a medieval high-school. Shrek and his trusted companions, Donkey and Puss in Boots, set out to bring Artie back but find their mission is a bigger challenge than they expected.
